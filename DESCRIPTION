Description: A collection of functions for researchers in digital agriculture to access,
    process, and visualize meteorological and spatial data. Includes tools to download
    weather data from online stations (such as Weather Underground), generate regular or
    random sampling grids from polygons (e.g., shapefiles or KMLs), calculate spatial
    transformations, and export data in formats suitable for geographic analysis and
    mapping. Designed to support geospatial workflows and agronomic data analysis.
